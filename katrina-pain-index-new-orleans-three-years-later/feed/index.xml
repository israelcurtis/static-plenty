					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a registered nurse and Katrina volunteer with Plenty International since the storm hit three years ago. I recently moved to New Orleans after securing a job in a local hospital. My hope is to make a difference in helping to change the course of this third world lifestyle for the poor of New Orleans. As I write this letter, I pray none of these tropical storms out in the gulf decide to make landfall here because this area could not stand another hit like that of Katrina and Rita. Our government, along with the vast majority of Americans have forgotten this place. All the non profits who are working to bring the coast back on course struggle for funding of their projects. It is the dedicated few still here three years later trying to give a voice to the disenfranchised. Let&#039;s give them a voice on this three year anniversary of Katrina. 

Sincerely,
Elaine Langley
Registered Nurse and Plenty International volunteer]]></description>
