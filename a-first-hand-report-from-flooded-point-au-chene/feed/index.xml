					<description><![CDATA[Hello. I am glad to find someone else who wants to talk about these tribes. I have been trying to gather information on the troubles that they are going through for a project that will raise awareness of the difficulties they are facing. I first became interested in these tribes during the Hurricane Katrina/Rita days and raised money at my college to help the Isle de Jean Charles band. I haven&#039;t been able to find much information about the impact of recent hurricanes and am very interested in your blog. 
Have you any more developments to share?]]></description>
