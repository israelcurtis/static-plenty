		Comment on TENTS FOR HAITI by Patrick Gibbs		</title>

					<description><![CDATA[As tents gather, here&#039;s a proposal about how to start more robust shelter before the tents decay. The proposal -- &quot;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hexayurt.com/hexayurt_country/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hexayurt Country&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&quot; -- is by Vinay Gupta, who has extensive experience in disaster relief policy, as he puts it:

&quot;I&#039;m the guy who figures out how to rehouse people after a nuclear bomb goes off, or how to represent what people are really dying of in an easy-to-read diagram. That&#039;s what I do. Hexayurt Country, that&#039;s my domain: [2%] of the population have died or are dying, and now it&#039;s time to consider doing whatever it takes to keep people alive.&quot;

Pretty robust idea, read it at &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hexayurt.com/hexayurt_country/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hexayurt Country&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello. I am glad to find someone else who wants to talk about these tribes. I have been trying to gather information on the troubles that they are going through for a project that will raise awareness of the difficulties they are facing. I first became interested in these tribes during the Hurricane Katrina/Rita days and raised money at my college to help the Isle de Jean Charles band. I haven&#039;t been able to find much information about the impact of recent hurricanes and am very interested in your blog. 
Have you any more developments to share?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a registered nurse and Katrina volunteer with Plenty International since the storm hit three years ago. I recently moved to New Orleans after securing a job in a local hospital. My hope is to make a difference in helping to change the course of this third world lifestyle for the poor of New Orleans. As I write this letter, I pray none of these tropical storms out in the gulf decide to make landfall here because this area could not stand another hit like that of Katrina and Rita. Our government, along with the vast majority of Americans have forgotten this place. All the non profits who are working to bring the coast back on course struggle for funding of their projects. It is the dedicated few still here three years later trying to give a voice to the disenfranchised. Let&#039;s give them a voice on this three year anniversary of Katrina. 

Sincerely,
Elaine Langley
Registered Nurse and Plenty International volunteer]]></description>
