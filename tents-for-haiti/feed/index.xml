					<description><![CDATA[As tents gather, here&#039;s a proposal about how to start more robust shelter before the tents decay. The proposal -- &quot;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hexayurt.com/hexayurt_country/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hexayurt Country&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&quot; -- is by Vinay Gupta, who has extensive experience in disaster relief policy, as he puts it:

&quot;I&#039;m the guy who figures out how to rehouse people after a nuclear bomb goes off, or how to represent what people are really dying of in an easy-to-read diagram. That&#039;s what I do. Hexayurt Country, that&#039;s my domain: [2%] of the population have died or are dying, and now it&#039;s time to consider doing whatever it takes to keep people alive.&quot;

Pretty robust idea, read it at &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hexayurt.com/hexayurt_country/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hexayurt Country&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.]]></description>
