<p><em>Plenty International Delivers Essential Grey Water to Underserved Communities in Western North Carolina Following Hurricane Helene</em></p>
<p><strong>Western North Carolina, October 5, 2024</strong> – In the wake of the devastating Hurricane Helene, Plenty International has stepped up to provide critical support to underserved communities in Western North Carolina by delivering grey water for non-potable uses.</p>
<p>Hurricane Helene has left many communities without access to clean water, exacerbating the challenges faced by already vulnerable populations. Recognizing the urgent need, Plenty has mobilized its resources to deliver grey water, which can be used for essential activities such as sanitation, flushing toilets, and other non-drinking purposes.</p>
<p>“Access to water is a fundamental human right, and in times of crisis, it becomes even more crucial,” said Dan Bright, a Plenty disaster relief volunteer. “Our team is dedicated to ensuring that no one is left without the resources they need to maintain basic hygiene and dignity.”</p>
<p>The grey water being distributed is sourced from local treatment plants, rainwater harvesting systems, and local wells ensuring that it meets safety standards for its intended uses. This initiative is part of Plenty’s &#8216;s broader 50-year-old commitment to disaster relief and community support.</p>
<p>Residents in need of grey water can contact Plenty at<a href="mailto:info@plenty.org"> info@plenty.org</a> or visit <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PlentyInternational">Plenty International’s Facebook page</a> for more information on distribution points and schedules.</p>
<p>Plenty is also calling on volunteers and donors to support this critical initiative. “We are stronger together, and every contribution makes a difference,” added Dan. “Whether it’s through volunteering your time or making a donation, your support helps us reach more people in need.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Super Typhoon Haiyan</strong> struck the Philippines with massive force. Relief efforts are needed on a massive, long-term scale. Plenty is being asked to help the village of Alta Vista on the island of Leyte, which is home to about 1,500 people. Every house in the area lost their roof and/or sustained other damage. Alta Vista Elementary School, with 280 students and the preschool/daycare with 45 students, lost its roof, desks, books and supplies. Other schools in the area are in similar shape and need help.</p>
<p>DONATIONS ARE NEEDED NOW TO AID THESE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS</p>
<p>We will aid as many schools as we can, depending upon the amount of donations we receive. <div class="alert alert-success">This is an opportunity to help in a very specific and personal way to help this community get back on their feet!</div></p>
