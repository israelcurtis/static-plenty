					<description><![CDATA[It was an honor for Bio Liberty http://www.bioliberty.net/ to help Plenty International deliver and distribute these supplies. 

I have contacted the Mobile Broadcast News Bus. I requested that  they assist in documenting the needs and provide Internet communications in the area effected. They  have told me that they are working on plan to come in the next few weeks.
